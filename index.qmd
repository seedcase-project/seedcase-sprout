## Streamlined data management for every workflow

**Sprout** is at the backbone of the [**Seedcase
Project**](https://seedcase-project.org), offering a flexible solution
to structure and manage your data.

Sprout is a **Python package** with a flexible interface directed at
those whose task is to build up and organise data for a project or
research study, as well as for those who want more control over
individual steps in the data processing and management workflow.

We designed this package mainly for computationally technical personnel,
such as data engineers or software developers. It's designed to be
easily extended and customized to fit your needs, within a framework
that ensures your data is ultimately structured, organized, and usable.
