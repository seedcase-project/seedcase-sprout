## Manage your data in a consistent way

**Sprout** is at the backbone of the [**Seedcase
Project**](https://seedcase-project.org), offering a flexible solution
to structure and manage your data.

Sprout has three key components:

-   A **Python package** for organising and managing data
    programmatically.
-   A **CLI** for managing data directly from the terminal.
-   A **web interface** for an easy-to-use graphical experience.

With these options, you can choose the method that works best for your
workflow.
