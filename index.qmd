## Manage your data in a consistent way

**Sprout** is at the backbone of the [**Seedcase
Project**](https://seedcase-project.org), offering a flexible solution
to structure and manage your data.

Sprout is a **Python package** with four key modules:

-   A flexible `core` encapsuling Sprout's core functionalities,
    directed at developers.
-   An opinionated `lib` for organising and managing data
    programmatically.
-   A `cli` for managing data directly from the terminal.
-   An `app` providing a web interface for an easy-to-use
    graphical experience.

With these options, you can choose the method that works best for your
workflow.
