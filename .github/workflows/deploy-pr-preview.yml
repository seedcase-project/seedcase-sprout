    # The `on.EVENT` (e.g. `on.pull_request`) used above usually can be combined with other EVENTS
    # like `on.push`, `on.issues`, or `on.schedule`. But `on.workflow_run` doesn't work with other
    # EVENTS, like `on.pull_request`. So to make it only run on PRs, we need to use this `if` condition,
    # so that this only runs after the tests have successfully passed and only on pull requests.
