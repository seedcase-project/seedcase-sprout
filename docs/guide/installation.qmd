title: "Install Sprout"
---


In order for Seedcase Sprout to work it will need to be installed either
locally or on a server. This guide will show you how to install Sprout
using pip. The requirements are that you have Python 3.6 or higher
installed on your system, and that you are comfortable with using the
command line.

<!-- TODO: this callout might need to be its own include, since other docs will use it too -->

::: callout-important
Sprout assumes you have full control over the folders and files of the
system, or at least your user's home directory. This includes being
given space on a server that mostly has access through a Terminal, where
you have control over the directories you can write to.

## Install Sprout using pip

::: {.callout-tip title="Not too comfortable using the terminal? Look here!" collapse="true"}
If you're not comfortable using the terminal, fear not! Below you'll find a thorough
step-by-step guide to help you along.

<!-- TODO: Add instructions for people not comfortable with the terminal -->
:::
### 1. **Python** and **pip**

Sprout requires Python and pip to be installed on your system:

::: {.callout-note title="Software requirements"}
-   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.6â€“3.12
-   [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) version 19.0 or
    higher
    <!--TODO: Do we have a specific pip version we require? This version
    was taken from TensorFlow's installation guide. They do vary their
    version requirements based on OS, not sure if we should too?-->
:::

Check your Python and pip version by running the following commands in
your terminal:

``` bash
python3 --version
python3 -m pip --version
```

If you don't get a Python version between 3.6 and 3.12 (or at all), go
to the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download
and install Python.

If you don't have pip installed, you can install it by following the
instructions on the [pip
website](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### 2. **Install Sprout**

To install Sprout, make sure that pip is up to date by running the
following command in your terminal:

``` bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then, install Sprout directly from the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-sprout) by
running the following command:

``` bash
pip install seedcase_sprout@git+https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-sprout
```

### 3. **Check the installation**

To check that Sprout has been installed correctly, run the following
command in your terminal:

``` bash
python3 -c "import sprout.core as sp; print(sp.PackageProperties())"
```

If a `PackageProperties` object is returned, Sprout has been installed
successfully. 

Get started with your first data package by following the guide on 
[Creating and managing data packages](https://sprout.seedcase-project.org/docs/guide/packages).
