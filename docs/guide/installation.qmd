We designed Sprout to be installed for use either on your own computer
(locally) or on a server (remote). This guide will walk you through
installing Sprout. Regardless of how you install Sprout, you will need
to use the Terminal.

{{< include _preamble.qmd >}}

Before installing Sprout in either a virtual environment or system-wide,
you need the following:

-   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-   [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/installation/)

To check that you've installed these programs, run these commands in the
Terminal to check their versions:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
python3 --version
pipx --version
```

## Use in a project in a virtual environment

Python packages are generally recommended to be installed in a virtual
environment. This is a way to isolate the packages you install for a
specific project from the global system. There are several tools to
manage package dependencies and create virtual environments, such as
`venv`, `virtualenv`, and `poetry`. For this guide, we will use
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/main/#installing-with-pipx),
with at least version \>=2.0.

You can check that you've installed these programs by running this
command in your Terminal:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
poetry --version
```

We assume you've already created a Python project using `poetry new` and
your working directory in the Terminal is the project folder, which you
can determine with the `pwd` command. If you haven't made a Python
project using Poetry, follow the instructions on
[Poetry's](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) website.

You can now install Sprout directly from the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-sprout) by
running the following command:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
poetry add git+https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-sprout.git
```

You can check that Sprout installed correctly by running the following
command in your terminal:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
poetry show seedcase_sprout
```

If it installed successfully, it will show details about Sprout.

Get started with your first data package by following the guide on
[Creating and managing data packages](/docs/guide/packages.qmd).

## Use anywhere on the computer or in the Terminal

While we *strongly* recommend using Sprout in a virtual environment of a
specific Python project folder, there are some situations where you
might want to install Sprout system-wide. This will allow you to use
Sprout from any folder on your computer or in the Terminal. The easiest
way to do this is to use pipx.

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
pipx install git+https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-sprout.git
```

To check that Sprout has been installed correctly, run the following:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
pipx show seedcase_sprout
```

Now you can use `seedcase_sprout` in any Python script throughout your
computer.
