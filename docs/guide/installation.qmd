title: "Installing Seedcase Sprout using pip"

{{< include /docs/includes/_wip.qmd >}}

In order for Seedcase Sprout to work it will need to be installed either
locally or on a server. This guide will show you how to install Sprout
using pip. The requirements are that you have Python 3.6 or higher
installed on your system, and that you are comfortable with using the
command line.

<!-- TODO: this callout might need to be its own include, since other docs will use it too -->

Sprout assumes you have full control over the folders and files of the
system, or at least your user's home directory. This includes being
given space on a server that mostly has access through a Terminal, where
you have control over the directories you can write to.

## Installing Sprout using pip

### Making sure your system is ready

There are some things you will need to ensure are installed on your
system before you can install Sprout. You will need python 3.6 or
higher, pip, and pipenv.

Once you have python installed (see the [Python
website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't have it on your
machine), you can check if you have pip installed by running the
following command in your terminal:

`pip --version` the reply to this should be a version number. If you do
not have pip installed, you can install it by following the instructions
on the [pip website](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/). If
pip is outdated it will tell you, and provide guidance on how to update
it.

You will also need to check that pipenv is installed. You can do this by
running the following command in your terminal:

`pipenv --version` the reply to this should be a version number. If you
do not have pipenv installed, you can install it by running the
following command in your terminal:

`pip install pipenv` this installation will take a little while, but
once it is done you will be able to install Sprout.

### Installing Sprout

### Local installation

Start by deciding where you want to store your data packages. By
default, Sprout will be installed in the directory that your terminal is
currently in. If you want to install Sprout in a different directory,
you can navigate to that directory in your terminal before running the
installation command (if you don't know how to navigate directories in
your terminal, you can find a guide
[here](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands)).

Once you have decided where you want to install Sprout, you can run the
following command in your terminal:

`pip install seedcase_sprout@git+https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-sprout`

this will install Sprout on your system. Once the installation is
complete, you will be able to run Sprout from the command line.

### Server installation
