title: "Installing Sprout"
order: 0
---

We designed Sprout to be installed for use either on your own computer
(locally) or on a server (remote). This guide will walk you through
installing Sprout. Regardless of how you install Sprout, you will need
to use the Terminal. If you are unfamiliar with the terminal, start with our
[guide for beginners]() before continuing.

<!-- TODO: this callout might need to be its own include, since other docs will use it too -->

Sprout as a Python package and as a CLI assumes you have full control
over the folders and files of the system, or at least your user's home
directory. This includes being given space on a server that mostly has
access through a Terminal, where you have control over the directories
you can write to.

## Use in a project in a virtual environment

Sprout requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version
\>=3.6 be installed on your system, which includes pip. Run this command
in the Terminal to check your version of Python:

``` bash
python3 --version
```

If the version isn't 3.6 or greater, download and install the latest
version of Python by going to their [download
page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Creating a virtual environment

In general, it isn't recommended to use pip to install into your global
system (accessible everywhere on your computer) because it can
negatively affect other Python packages. Rather, you install a package
into a virtual environment so that it doesn't affect your global system.

To make this virtual environment, we need to create it with venv in a
folder location that makes sense for your purposes. A good location
might be in your documents folder or desktop. For now, we will create it
on the desktop:

``` bash
cd Desktop
mkdir use-sprout
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

<!-- TODO: Write instructions using Poetry as well -->

You're now ready to install Sprout!

### Install Sprout

We can install Sprout directly from the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-sprout) by
running the following command:

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-sprout
```

To check that Sprout has been installed correctly, run the following
command in your terminal:

``` bash
pip show seedcase_sprout
```

If it installed successfully, it will show details about Sprout.

Get started with your first data package by following the guide on
[Creating and managing data packages](/docs/guide/packages.qmd).

## Use anywhere on the computer or in the Terminal
