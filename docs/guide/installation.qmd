Before installing Sprout, you need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and a Python package manager installed. For the latter, we recommend using uv which can be [installed via a shell script](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer) or [via pipx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#pypi).

To check that these programs are installed, run the following commands
in your Terminal:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
python3 --version
uv --version
```

If Python and uv are installed, these commands will show you the
versions installed on your system. If you get an error, you need to
install them before continuing.

## Install Sprout in a virtual environment (recommended)

While you could install sprout globally (via pip, pipx, etc), we recommend
installing it (and any other python packages you use) locally in a separate
virtual environment for each project you are working on. This makes it easier
to keep track of which package versions you are using for a specific project
which increases reproducibility.

To create a virtual environment for your project, you can use uv to
initialize a "Python project". uv This will add the required files to keep track of your virtual environment and also add files

You can create a Python project using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
In short, you can create a new project using uv by running the following
command in your Terminal (assuming we make a new data package called
`diabetes-study`):

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
uv init diabetes-study
```

This will create a new directory called `diabetes-study` with the basic
structure of a Python project. It should look like:

<!-- TODO: Auto-create this some how? -->

```
diabetes-study/
├── .git/
├── .gitignore
├── .python-version
├── README.md
├── main.py
└── pyproject.toml
```

uv also creates the folder as a Git repository. For more information on
working on projects with uv, see their
[guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/). Of the files
created, the most important ones for your data package are the
`pyproject.toml` and `main.py` files. The `pyproject.toml` file is used
to manage the dependencies of the project, while the `main.py` file is
where you will coordinate the Python scripts in your project.

<!-- TODO: eventually flip callout content so the template is recommended and not uv -->

You can generate the basic structure of a data package by using the
Seedcase Project
[`template-data-package`](https://github.com/seedcase-project/template-data-package).
There are instructions there on how to use it to make the initial
structure of a data package.
:::

After creating the project, open the project folder (in this case
`diabetes-study`) in your Terminal. Run the `pwd` command to confirm
that your working directory is the project folder.

You can now install Sprout with this command:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
uv add seedcase-sprout
```

Check that Sprout has been installed correctly by running this command:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
uv pip show seedcase_sprout
```

If Sprout has been installed successfully, the output will show details
about Sprout.

Get started with your first data package by following the guide on
[Creating and managing data packages](/docs/guide/packages.qmd).
