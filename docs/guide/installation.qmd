Before installing Sprout, you need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/installation/) installed.

To check that these programs are installed, run the following commands in your
Terminal:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
python3 --version
pipx --version
```

If Python and pipx are installed, these commands will show you the versions installed on your system. If you get an error, you need to install them before continuing.

## Install Sprout in a virtual environment (recommended)

It's generally recommended to install Python packages in a virtual
environment to keep a project's dependencies separate from the system-wide Python setup and avoid conflicts. There are several tools to
manage package dependencies and create virtual environments, such as
venv, virtualenv, and uv. For this guide, we will use
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

If you don't have uv installed, you can install it in your Terminal with pipx:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
pipx install uv
```

To check that uv is installed, run this
command:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
uv
```

To create a Python project using uv, follow the instructions on
[uv's](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) website. After creating the project, make sure your Terminal's working directory is in the project folder. You can determinate this by running the `pwd` command.

You can now install Sprout directly from the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-sprout):

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
uv add git+https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-sprout.git
```

Check that Sprout has been installed correctly by running this
command:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
uv pip show seedcase_sprout
```

If Sprout has been installed successfully, the output will show details about Sprout.

Get started with your first data package by following the guide on
[Creating and managing data packages](/docs/guide/packages.qmd).

## Install Sprout in system-wide

We strongly recommend using Sprout in a virtual environment, but you can also install it system-wide. The easiest way to do that is to use pipx:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
pipx install git+https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-sprout.git
```

To check that Sprout has been installed correctly, run the following and make sure `seedcase_sprout` is listed:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
pipx list
```

Now you can use Sprout in any Python script throughout your
computer.
