title: "Installing Seedcase Sprout using pip"
---

{{< include /docs/includes/_wip.qmd >}}

In order for Seedcase Sprout to work it will need to be installed either locally or on a server. This guide will show
you how to install Sprout using pip. The requirements are that you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system, and that you are comfortable with using the command line.

<!-- TODO: this callout might need to be its own include, since other docs will use it too -->

::: callout-important
Sprout assumes you have full
control over the folders and files of the system, or at least your
user's home directory. This includes being given space on a server that
mostly has access through a Terminal, where you have control over the
directories you can write to.
