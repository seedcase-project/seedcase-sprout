In the last section, we saw how to write a minimal set of metadata properties
to `datapackage.json`. Here, we will take a closer look at the full
`package_properties.py` that is created by `create_properties_script()`. First,
delete file `scripts/package_properties.py` and change your `main.py` back to
look like this:

```{python}
#| eval: true
#| filename: "main.py"
import seedcase_sprout as sp

def main():
    # Create the properties script in the default location.
    sp.create_properties_script()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now run the script from terminal:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
uv run main.py
```

If you now view the created `package_properties.py` script, you will see that
it lists many of the most commonly used metadata names together with comments
indicating which are required and which are optional:

<!-- Create the script where quarto can find it for building the docs -->
{{< include _python-minimal-package-setup.qmd >}}
```{python}
#| include: false
sp.create_properties_script(package_path.root())
```


```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
#| filename: "scripts/package_properties.py"
print(
    '```python',
    package_path.properties_script().read_text(),
    '```',
    sep='\n'
)
```
