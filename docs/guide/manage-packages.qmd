In the last section, we saw how to write a minimal set of metadata properties
to `datapackage.json`. Here, we will take a closer look at the full
`package_properties.py` that is created by `create_properties_script()`. First,
delete file `scripts/package_properties.py` and change your `main.py` back to
look like this:

```{python}
#| eval: true
#| filename: "main.py"
import seedcase_sprout as sp

def main():
    # Create the properties script in the default location.
    sp.create_properties_script()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now run the script from terminal:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
uv run main.py
```
