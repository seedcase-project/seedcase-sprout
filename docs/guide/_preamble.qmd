For both the Python library and the CLI, Sprout assumes you have full
control over the folders and files of the system, or at least your
user's home directory. This includes being given space on a server that
mostly has access through a Terminal, where you have control over the
directories you can write to.

An easy example of this is if you install Sprout on your own computer
because you want to create some data packages for research studies you
are running. Another example would be if your research group has storage
space on a server that you need to use a Terminal and SSH to be able to
access.
