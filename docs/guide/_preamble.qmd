Whether you're using the Python library or the CLI, Sprout assumes you have full
control over the system's folders and files, or at least your
user's home directory. This includes being given space on a server that
is primarily accessed through a terminal, where you have control over the
directories you can write to.

For example, you might install Sprout on your own computer
because you want to create data packages for your research studies.
Alternatively, your research group might have storage
space on a server that requires the use of a terminal and SSH to
access.
