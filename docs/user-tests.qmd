## Introduction

To our user tests, we aim to provide context for users to effectively evaluate Sprout's features. For this purpose, we've crafted a basic case that includes three simple test data files.

In the sections below, we will briefly [introduce
Sprout](#a-short-introduction-to-sprout), describe the
[context](#context) we would like the user to test Sprout based on, and
list the actions that we would like the [user to try to
do](#what-we-would-like-you-to-do).

These sections are intented for a user to read before the user test.

## A short introduction to Sprout {#a-short-introduction-to-sprout}

Sprout is a component of the Seedcase software ecosystem which is a framework for an open and scalable infrastructure for health data. The Seedcase ecosystem aims to enable researchers to build, manage, and share health data using modern best software practices. 

Sprout is the component for building or "growing" data and aims to:

> take data created or collected for research studies and "grow" it
> in a structured way using modern best practices for storing data.

In Sprout, there are two steps to structuring and storing your data:

1.  Create metadata

2.  Add data to the metadata

**Metadata** refers to data that provides information *about* other
data. It describes various attributes of data, such as the *name* of the
metadata and a *description* of what it contains, as well as describes
*which variables* are in the data, *what data types* they are, and a
*description* of what they are (which could include relevant information
such as the unit of the variable).

**Data** refers to the actual actual values or content that is being
described, analysed, or manipulated. It can be in various forms, such as
text, numbers, or even images or audio (however, currently, Sprout only
supports tabular data).

So in order to grow your data in a structured way, you begin by
describing your data through metadata, and then you can start to add, or
grow, your data in a structured way! Nice!

## Context {#context}

You're a researcher collecting data on a diabetes patients and their
exercise. You want to save and structure your data to ease the process
of 1) adding more data to your dataset, when more has been collected,
and 2) analysing the data later on.

You have collected the data across two time periods (in 2023 and 2024),
resulting in two distinct cohorts. Each cohort represents the same group
of individuals who tracked their exercise in March 2023 and 2024,
respectively.

You have two types of files with data: One describing the patients
`patients` which includes their age, sex, height, weight, and diabetes
type, and one describing their exercise patterns `exercise` which
includes when they exercised, what kind of exercise, and for how long.

You have two of each file type, one for each time period:
`patients.csv`, `exercise_2023.csv`, and `exercise_2024.csv`.

| id  | age | sex | height | weight | diabetes_type |
|-----|-----|-----|--------|--------|---------------|
| 01  | 54  | F   | 167.5  | Â 70.3  | Type 1        |
| 02  | 66  | M   | 175    | Â 80.5  | Type 2        |

: Showing the `patients.csv` and the first two rows within that file.

| id  | exercise type | duration | date       |
|-----|---------------|----------|------------|
| 01  | run           | 10       | 01-03-2024 |
| 02  | wall          | 25       | 175        |

: Showing the `exercise_2024.csv` and the first two rows within that
file.

Since you want to grow your data in a structured way, you decide to try
out Sprout for handling your data.

## What we would like you to do {#what-we-would-like-you-to-do}

Now, that you have gotten a short introduction to the context and
Sprout, we would like you to try to do the three steps described below.

As you do it, we would like you to tell us your thought processes about
what you're doing and why it makes/doesn't make sense to do. We will try
to refrain from explaining and helping you too much along the way.

::: callout-note
An important aspect of user testing for you as the user is that **there
are no right or wrong answers.**

If something is unclear to you, it is a great oppurtunity for us to
learn how to make it clearer going forward - this is exactly why user
tests are so helpful for us!
:::

The three steps we would like you to try to do is:

1.  Create the metadata for the `patients.csv`
2.  Create the metadata for `exercise_2023.csv` and call it `exercise`
3.  Add the data from `exercise_2024.csv` to the `exercise` metadata

Just take one at the time and please remember to say your thought
processes out loud.

Thank you so much for your help and your time! :-)
