## What is Sprout?

Sprout is a Python package that is designed to help create and manage a
standardised and organised structure for storing and describing data,
with a focus on research data. It tries to incorporate modern data
engineering and management practices to help ensure and enforce that
research data are well-designed, discoverable, well-documented, and
ultimately more (re)usable for later analyses.

Specifically, Sprout does this by integrating everything around the
[Frictionless Data
Package](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-frictionless-data/)
standard, storing the data in the [Apache
Parquet](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-parquet/) format,
and using a specific directory structure to organise the data into a
["data package"](/docs/glossary.qmd) with one or more ["data
resources"](/docs/glossary.qmd).

## Why use it?

There many tools for processing, or cleaning, or transforming data, or
for storing them in databases on servers and building data warehouses.
However, there aren't many tools that specifically help create
structured and organised data that is directly linked to the data's
metadata, nor are there many tools that help create and structure that
metadata. Without metadata, data is nearly unusable.

Sprout integrates a few key standards and practices to help build a
fantastic dataset *along with its metadata*. In that way, it ensures the
data will be more easily usable for later analysis, for finding the
right data needed for the analysis, and for better understanding of what
is actually in the data.

In particular, because Sprout is a Python package, you can use Python as
you normally would to help build your data package. You don't need to
learn another tool nor use a new interface. It's just code.

There are few tools available that we've found that do what Sprout does.
But there are a few similar tools available, though with quite different
purposes and use-cases, such as:

-   [Open Data Editor](https://opendataeditor.okfn.org/): Is a web- and
    click-based tool for creating and editing data packages.
-   [gen3](https://gen3.org/): Is a web-based platform for building data
    commons.

This website contains documentation on Sprout's design, how to use it,
and details about the interface.

-   [Design](/docs/design/index.qmd): The design section describes the
    architecture and interface of Sprout, the requirements, use-cases,
    user personas, and the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/).
-   [How-to guide](/docs/guide/index.qmd): The guide section provides a
    step-by-step introduction to using Sprout, including installation,
    setup, and creating and managing data packages.
-   [Reference](/docs/reference/index.qmd): The reference section
    contains detailed information about the Sprout Python Package API,
    specifically the documentation of individual classes, methods, and
    functions.
