title: User roles and permissions
---

{{< include /includes/_wip.qmd >}}

There are three roles given to users: Project owner, project
administrator (or project admin), and data contributor. Each role comes
with a set of permissions that give access to different actions within
Sprout.

<!-- TODO: Create a role and permission for table level admin? -->

## Roles

### Project owner

The project owner is designed for those users who want to create a new
project to store data and who want full control over the project in
Sprout. This role also includes having direct access to the database
backend. Whoever creates a project is by default assigned the project
owner role. A project owner can assign roles to any other user. In
general, it is good practice to have at least two project owners, in
case of any issues with the primary project owner (e.g. emergency or
unavailable).

### Project administrator

The project administrator (or project admin) role is designed for those
who can take some of the responsibilities and tasks off of the project
owner, without being given full control over the project. Ideally, a
project admin user is someone who is familiar with the research data
that is being stored.

Tasks relate to general and technical administration of the project,
users, metadata, and data. For instance, some specific tasks might be:

-   Assessing or correcting any issues in the quality of the entered
    data itself.
-   Resolving any issues that the data contributors have during data
    upload.
-   Creating the metadata structure, so that data can be uploaded to it.
-   Updating the metadata content or structure.

### Data contributor

The data contributor role is designed for those uploading data into
Sprout. These users will likely be researchers, student assistants, lab
technicians, or other research personnel from research or data
collection centers.

The specific task of a data contributor is to upload data into metadata
structures already created by either the project owner or project admin.

## Permissions

We follow the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) framework when
designing the permissions. There are a few types of objects in Seedcase
Sprout: Research data, data about the research data (metadata), users
within the project, and the project itself. Research data is the data
that a user wants to store in Sprout. The metadata is the data about the
research data. In order to store data, there needs to be the metadata
structure created first.

Permissions for roles work hierarchically, in that a project owner has
the same permissions as the project admin, which has the same
permissions as the data contributor, but not the other way around.

<!-- TODO: Consider having custom assigned permissions, rather than roles -->
