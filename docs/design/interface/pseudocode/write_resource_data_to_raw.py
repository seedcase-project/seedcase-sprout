    """Writes the raw data file into the resource's raw data folder.

    Copy the file from `data_path` over into the resource location given by
    `path`. This will compress the file and use a timestamped, unique file
    name to store it as a backup. See the
    [design](https://sprout.seedcase-project.org/docs/design/) docs for an
    explanation of this file. Use `path_resource_raw()` to provide the
    correct `path` location. Copies and compresses the file, and outputs the
    path object of the created file.

        Args:
            data_path: Path to a raw data file that you want Sprout to store
                into the data package.
            path: Path to the raw resources folder. Use `path_resources_raw()`
                to help provide the correct path.
            resource_properties: The properties object for the specific resource.
                Use `read_properties()` to read the properties for the resource
                and `get_properties()` to get the correct resource properties.

        Returns:
            The path to the written compressed raw resource file.
