title: "Interface"

This section of the documentation focuses on how the interface
will be implemented. It is split into the following set of
documents:

-   The main [Outputs](outputs.qmd), including the files, folders, and
    other artifacts that will be produced by Sprout.
-   The [Python functions](functions.qmd) that form the core of
    Sprout and its extensions.
