This section of the documentation focuses on how the architectural
design will be implemented. It is split into the following set of
documents:

-   The main [Outputs](outputs.qmd), including the files, folders, and
    other artifacts that will be produced by Sprout.
-   The [core Python functions](python-functions.qmd) that form the
    basis of Sprout and that are designed to be used in Python code as
    well as form the foundation of the CLI and web app.
-   The CLI commands (to be developed).
-   The [app endpoints and pages](app-urls.qmd) that includes the exact
    page URLS and their content, functionality, and interaction with
    other pages.
