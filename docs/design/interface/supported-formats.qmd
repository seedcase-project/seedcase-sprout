Currently, Sprout supports the extraction of properties from the
following data formats:

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
from seedcase_sprout.core.check_is_supported_format import SUPPORTED_FORMATS

print("`." + "`, `.".join(sorted(SUPPORTED_FORMATS)) + "`")
```

For more information on how to extract properties from these formats,
see the [Creating and managing data
resources](/docs/guides/resources.qmd) guide.
