::: callout-important
We created this document mainly as a way to help us as a team all
understand and agree on what we're making and what needs to be worked
on. This means that the flows may change quite substantially until we've
reached a stable full release at `v1.0.0`.
:::

Based on the [functions](functions.qmd) that list and describe the main
functions and classes that make up the interface, this document
describes and shows how all these objects work together and flow into
one another, but not necessarily the functions exact input and output.
Those are already described in the [functions](functions.qmd) document.

Each diagram uses specific shapes and lines to represent different
things:

-   A dotted line between objects/functions means the flow is optional.
-   A solid line between objects/functions means the flow is required
    and is the next step.
-   A cylinder means an object such as a class or file.
-   A rectangle with rounded corners means an action like a function or
    method.

For some reason, the diagrams below don't display well on some browsers
like Firefox. To see them, try using a different browser like Chrome or
Edge.

## Update resource properties

If you want to make a change to one or more of the properties inside the
resource properties, this would be the flow you use. While the
`update_resource_properties()` and `write_resource_properties()`
functions will internally call `check_resource_properties()`, they can
also be called separately to check the properties before updating them
in the `datapackage.json` file.
