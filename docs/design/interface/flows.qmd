::: callout-important
We created this document mainly as a way to help us as a team all
understand and agree on what we're making and what needs to be worked
on. This means that the flows may change quite substantially until we've
reached a stable full release at `v1.0.0`.
:::

Based on the [functions](functions.qmd) that list and describe the main
functions and classes that make up the interface, this document
describes and shows how all these objects work together and flow into
one another, but not necessarily the functions exact input and output.
Those are already described in the [functions](functions.qmd) document.

Each diagram uses specific shapes and lines to represent different
things:

-   A dotted line between objects/functions means the flow is optional.
-   A solid line between objects/functions means the flow is required
    and is the next step.
-   A cylinder means an object such as a class or file.
-   A rectangle with rounded corners means an action like a function or
    method.

like Firefox. To see them, try using a different browser like Chrome or

## Save new, added, or modified raw data to batch

A data resource needs data, not just properties. You can add data to any
data resource that has resource properties. Whenever data is
added to a data resource, it gets first saved in the `batch/`
folder to keep track of additions or changes. You add the data when:

-   A new data resource is created and data is added to it.
-   Additional data is added to an existing data resource.
-   You need to fix, update, or modify existing data in the resource by
    correcting the data (e.g. fixing a data entry issue).

The data must be in a tidy format and must have already been
loaded in as a Polars DataFrame.
