::: callout-important
We created this document mainly as a way to help us as a team all
understand and agree on what we're making and what needs to be worked
on. This means that the flows may change quite substantially until we've
reached a stable full release at `v1.0.0`.
:::

Based on the [functions](functions.qmd) that list and describe the main
functions and classes that make up the interface, this document
describes and shows how all these objects work together and flow into
one another, but not necessarily the functions exact input and output.
Those are already described in the [functions](functions.qmd) document.

Each diagram uses specific shapes and lines to represent different
things:

-   A dotted line between objects/functions means the flow is optional.
-   A solid line between objects/functions means the flow is required
    and is the next step.
-   A cylinder means an object such as a class or file.
-   A rectangle with rounded corners means an action like a function or
    method.

## Extract resource properties from raw data

The flow for extracting resource properties from raw data. This is
useful when the raw data is in a format that contains metadata about the
data, such as a CSV file with a header row that contains the column
names. The `update_resource_properties()` function will internally call
`check_resource_properties()`. The `extract_resource_properties()`
function cannot extract all required properties from the raw data, so
it must be updated by the user. While `TableSchemaProperties` or
`ResourceProperties` can be updated, the properties in
`ResourceProperties` must all be filled in and the
`extract_resource_properties()` function is not able to fill in most of
the important properties.
