::: callout-important
We created this document mainly as a way to help us as a team all
understand and agree on what we're making and what needs to be worked
on. This means that the flows may change quite substantially until we've
reached a stable full release at `v1.0.0`.
:::

Based on the [functions](functions.qmd) that list and describe the main
functions and classes that make up the interface, this document
describes and shows how all these objects work together and flow into
one another, but not necessarily the functions exact input and output.
Those are already described in the [functions](functions.qmd) document.

Each diagram uses specific shapes and lines to represent different
things:

-   A dotted line between objects/functions means the flow is optional.
-   A solid line between objects/functions means the flow is required
    and is the next step.
-   A cylinder means an object such as a class or file.
-   A rectangle with rounded corners means an action like a function or
    method.

## Deleting an observational unit

If you need to delete an observational unit from the data, you can use
this flow. The `delete_observational_unit()` function will delete the
observational unit from the data about output a list of DataFrames with
the deletions. The `write_resource_batches()` function will save the
updated data back to the batch files.

<!-- TODO: I don't know how the saving back to the batch files will work yet. -->
