::: callout-important
We created this document, and especially the function diagrams, mainly
as a way to help us as a team all understand and agree on what we're
making and what needs to be worked on. Which means that the descriptions
and explanations of these functions, in particular the diagrams, will
likely change quite a bit and may even be deleted later when they are no
longer needed.
:::

Based on the [naming scheme](naming.qmd) and the [Frictionless Data
Package standard](https://datapackage.org), these are the core
external-facing functions in Sprout, which are stored in `sprout/core/`.
See the [Outputs](outputs.qmd) section for an overview and explanation
of the different outputs provided by Sprout.

There are some small differences between the naming scheme and the
functions described here:

1.  Whenever `view` is used, it is always for one object (either a
    package or a resource). Whenever `list` is used, it is always to
    show basic details of all existing objects of a given type (packages
    or resources). Both `view` and `list` only ever show the information
    contained in the `datapackage.json` and never show actual data. We
    don't provide the ability to view data directly since it is [out of
    scope](index.qmd#goals) of Sprout and we want to minimise any
    security and privacy risks. The IT admin and data package admin
    users can always view the data directly (outside of Sprout) as they
    will have the appropriate IT and legal permissions.
2.  `edit` only ever edits the `datapackage.json` which contains the
    properties/metadata of the package or resource(s) but never edits
    the data itself. If there is a need for updates to the data itself,
    the user can update it by uploading a new file with the updates (as
    long as the primary keys like participant ID and time of collection
    are the same). We don't provide access for users to directly edit
    the data because we want to limit security risks as well as to
    maintain privacy and legal compliance.
3.  `add` only ever adds more data to an existing data resource and does
    not add any new metadata to the `datapackage.json`. Since Sprout
    contains the full Frictionless Data specification, using `edit` is
    enough to make updates to the existing properties found in the
    `datapackage.json` file.

Nearly all functions have a `path` argument. Depending on what the
function does, the path object will be different. Use the `path_*()`
functions to get the correct path object for the specific function. It's
designed this way to make it more flexible to where individual packages
and resources are stored and to make it a bit easier to write tests for
the functions. For a similar reason, most of the functions output either
a JSON file or path object to make them easier to test.

Several of the functions have an optional argument called `properties`.
The properties argument is a list of key-value pairs (as a JSON object)
that describe the package and resource(s) in the package. This metadata
is stored in the `datapackage.json` file and follows the Frictionless
Data specification.

## Data package functions

### `list_packages(path)`

This function lists some basic details contained in the
`datapackage.json` files of all data packages found in the `path`
location. This would be a list, showing very basic information that
would be allowed by privacy and legal regulations (e.g. the package ID
as well as the name, description, and contact persons for each package).
Use `path_sprout_root()` to provide the path to the place packages are
stored by default. Outputs a JSON object by default.

### `view_package_properties(path)`

This will show the information contained within the `datapackage.json`
file of a package for only the fields relevant to the package itself,
and only basic details of the resources within the package. Use
`path_properties()` to provide the correct path location. Outputs a JSON
object.

### `create_package_structure(path)`

This is the first function to use to create a new data package. It
assigns a package ID and then creates a package folder and all the
necessary files for a package (excluding the resources), as described in
the [Outputs](outputs.qmd) section. Creates the files and then outputs
the file paths for the created files. Use `path_package()` to provide
the correct path location to create this structure.

`create_package_structure()`
function.](images/core-python-functions/create-package-structure.svg){#fig-create-package-structure
fig-alt="A Plant UML schematic of the detailed code flow within the `create_package_structure()` function."}

### `create_package_properties(path, properties)`

This is the second function to use to create a new data package. It is
used to fill in the details in the `datapackage.json` file by using the
`properties` argument which must be a JSON object. The `properties`
argument must follow the Frictionless Data specification. To get a JSON
object that follows the correct specification use
`view_package_properties_template()`. Use `path_properties()` to provide
the correct path location. Outputs a JSON object only. Use
`write_package_properties()` to save back to the `datapackage.json`
file.

![Diagram showing the internal function flow of the
`create_package_properties()`
function.](images/core-python-functions/create-package-properties.svg){#fig-create-package-properties
fig-alt="A Plant UML schematic of the detailed code flow within the `create_package_properties()` function."}

### `edit_package_properties(path, properties)`

Make edits to the `datapackage.json` properties of a specific package.
Only edits metadata on the package itself, not on the data resources
contained within the package. The `properties` argument must follow the
Frictionless Data specification. Use
`view_package_properties_template()` to get a JSON object that follows
the correct specification. Use `path_properties()` in the `path`
argument to provide the correct location for the file. Outputs a JSON
object only. Use `write_package_properties()` to save back to the
`datapackage.json` file.

### `delete_package(path, confirm)`

Completely delete a specific package and all it's data resources.
Because this action would be permanent, the `confirm` argument would
default to `false` so that the user needs to explicitly provide `true`
to the function argument as confirmation. This is done to prevent
accidental deletion. Use `path_package()` function in the `path` to get
the correct location. Outputs `true` if the deletion was successful.

### `write_package_properties(properties, path)`

Writes JSON object containing package properties (not including resource
properties) back to the `datapackage.json` file. The `path` argument is
the location of the `datapackage.json` file. Use the `path_properties()`
function to provide this path to the correct location. Returns the same
path object as given in the `path` argument.

## Data resource functions

### `list_resources(path)`

This looks in one specific package's `datapackage.json` file and lists a
basic summary of all the data resources contained within the package.
The list would be basic information like resource ID, name, and
description. Use `path_package()` to provide the correct path location.
Outputs a JSON object.

### `view_resource(path, properties_path)`

Views the information on a package's specific resource that is contained
within the `datapackage.json` file. Use the `path_resource()` function
to provide the correct location for the `path` and `path_properties()`
for the `properties_path` argument. Outputs a JSON object.

### `create_resource_structure(path)`

This is the first function to use to set up the structure for a data
resource. It creates the paths for a new data resource in a specific
(existing) package by creating the folder setup described in the
[Outputs](outputs.qmd) section. Use the `path_resources()` function to
provide the correct path location. It creates two paths: the
`resources/<id>/` path and the `resources/<id>/raw/` path. The output is
a list of these two path objects.

### `create_resource_properties(path, properties)`

This function sets up and structures a new resource property by taking
the fields given in the `properties` argument to fill them and prepare
them to be added to the `datapackage.json` file. It must be given as a
JSON object following the Data Package specification (use
`view_resource_properties_template()` to get a JSON object that follows
the Frictionless Data Package standard). The `path` argument provides
the path to the resource `id` that the properties are for; use
`path_resource()` to provide the correct path. Outputs a JSON object
only; use `write_resource_properties()` to save the JSON object to the
`datapackage.json` file.

![Diagram showing the internal function flow of the
`create_resource_structure()`
function.](images/core-python-functions/create-resource-structure.svg){#fig-create-resource-structure
fig-alt="A Plant UML schematic of the detailed code flow within the `create_resource_structure()` function."}

Use `path_resource()` to provide the correct `path` location or use the
output of `create_resource_structure()`. Outputs a JSON object only; use
`write_resource_properties()` to save the JSON object to the
`datapackage.json` file.

![Diagram showing the internal function flow of the
`create_resource_properties()`
function.](images/core-python-functions/create-resource-properties.svg){#fig-create-resource-properties
fig-alt="A Plant UML schematic of the detailed code flow within the `create_resource_properties()` function."}

### `write_resource_data_to_raw(path, data_path)`

Copy the file from `data_path` over into the resource location given by
`path`. This will compress the file and use a timestamped, unique file
name to store it as a backup. See the explanation of this file in the
[Outputs](outputs.qmd) section. Use `path_resource_raw()` to provide the
correct `path` location. Copies and compresses the file, and outputs the
path object of the created file.

### `write_resource_parquet(raw_files, path)`

This function takes the files provided by `raw_files` and merges them
into a `data.parquet` file provided by `path`. Use
`path_resource_data()` to provide the correct path location for `path`
and `path_resources_raw_files()` for the `raw_files` argument. Outputs
the path object of the created file.

### `edit_resource_properties(path, properties)`

Edit the properties of a resource in a package. The `properties`
argument must be a JSON object that follows the Frictionless Data
specification. Use the `path_properties()` function to provide the
correct path location. Outputs a JSON object only; use
`write_resource_properties()` to save the JSON object to the
`datapackage.json` file.

### `delete_resource_raw_file(path, confirm)`

Use this to delete a raw file in the `raw/` folder of a resource. This
is useful if the file is no longer needed or if it is incorrect or had
an issue during the time when a user first added the file to a resource.
Use `path_resource_raw_files()` to select which file to delete from the
list of files found. Will only delete one file. The `confirm` argument
defaults to `false` so that the user needs to explicitly provide `true`
to the function argument as confirmation. This is done to prevent
accidental deletion. Outputs `true` if the deletion was successful.

### `delete_resource_data(path, confirm)`

Delete all data (Parquet and in the database) and raw data of a specific
resource. Use `path_resource_raw()` to provide the correct path
location. The `confirm` argument defaults to `false` so that the user
needs to explicitly provide `true` to the function argument as
confirmation. This is done to prevent accidental deletion. Outputs
`true` if the deletion was successful. Use
`delete_resource_properties()` to delete the the associated
properties/metadata for the resource.

### `delete_resource_properties(path, confirm)`

Deletes all properties for a resource within the `datapackage.json`
file. Use `path_properties()` to provide the correct location for
`path`. The `confirm` argument defaults to `false` so that the user
needs to explicitly provide `true` to the function argument as
confirmation. This is done to prevent accidental deletion. Outputs
`true` if the deletion was successful.

### `write_resource_properties(properties, path)`

Use to write the resource JSON object back to the `datapackage.json`
file. This function validates whether the JSON object follows the Data
Package resource specification. The `path` argument is the location of
the `datapackage.json` file. Use the `path_properties()` function to
provide this path to the correct location. Returns the same path object
as given in the `path` argument.

### `write_resource_to_database(data, path, properties)`

Writes a data object to the `path` database location. Use
`path_resource_database()` to provide the correct location for the
`path` object. The `properties` argument, using `view_resource()`,
ensures the correct table is created in the database. Outputs the same
`path` object as well as the name of the newly created database table.

### `extract_resource_properties(path, data_path)`

This takes the data found at the `data_path` location and creates a JSON
object following the Frictionless Data standard. Internally it uses the
frictionless Python package to guess and fill in some of the property
fields required by the Frictionless Data resource specification. This
function is often followed by `edit_resource_properties()` to fill in
any remaining missing fields and then the `verify_resource_properties()`
function. Usually, you use either this function or the
`create_resource_properties()` function to create the resource
properties for the specific data resource given. The `path` argument
points to the resource `id` folder; use `path_resource()` to help give
the correct path. Outputs a JSON object. Use
`write_resource_properties()` to save the JSON object to the
`datapackage.json` file.

## Path functions

-   Nearly all the below `path_*()` functions use `path_sprout_root()`
    internally to get the root path as well as `package_id` and/or
    `resource_id` to complete the correct path for the specific
    package/resource.
-   All of these functions output a path object.
-   The paths returned by all of these functions are paths that exist,
    so all include a `verify_is_dir()` or `verify_is_file()` check.
-   If the wrong `package_id` or `resource_id` is given, an error
    message will include a list of all the actual `package_id` at the
    `path_sprout_root()` location or all actual `resource_id` for a
    specific package.

### `path_resources(package_id)`

Creates the absolute path to the package's resources directory.

### `path_resource(package_id, resource_id)`

Creates the absolute path to a specific resource directory within a
package.

### `path_resource_raw(package_id, resource_id)`

Creates the absolute path to a resource's raw data directory within a
package.

### `path_resource_raw_files(package_id, resource_id)`

Creates a list of absolute paths to all the raw data files within a
resource's raw data directory within a package.

### `path_resource_data(package_id, resource_id)`

Creates the absolute path to a resource's Parquet data file in a
package.

### `path_properties(package_id)`

Creates the absolute path to the package's properties `datapackage.json`
file.

### `path_package_database(package_id)`

Creates the absolute path to the package's database.

### `path_package(package_id)`

Creates the absolute path to the specific package folder.

### `path_sprout_root()`

If the `SPROUT_ROOT` environment variable isn't provided, this function
will return the default path to where data packages will be stored. The
default locations are dependent on the operating system. This function
also creates the necessary directory if it doesn't exist.

## Helper functions

::: callout-warning
These functions are still being developed.
:::

`pretty_json(json)`

:   Create a prettier, human readable version of a JSON object.

`create_properties_template(path)`

:   While mostly intended for internal purposes, this function can be
    useful to download and manually inspect the full Data Package
    specification for a package. The aim, at least internally, is to use
    this function to create a `datapackage.json` within Sprout core that
    other functions can use. The `path` argument is the path to where
    you want the file saved. Outputs the path of the created file.

    ![Diagram showing the internal function flow of the
    `create_properties_template()`
    function.](images/core-python-functions/create-properties-template.svg){#fig-create-properties-template
    fig-alt="A Plant UML schematic of the detailed code flow within the `create_properties_template()` function."}

`view_properties()`

:   TODO. Outputs a JSON object.

`view_package_properties_template()`

:   TODO. Outputs a JSON object.

`view_resource_properties_template()`

:   TODO. Outputs a JSON object.

## Observational unit level functions

Observational unit is the level of detail on the entity (e.g. human,
animal, event) that the data was collected on. Example would be: A
person in a research study who came to the clinic in May 2024 to have
their blood collected and to fill out a survey.

`delete_participant_data()`

:   TODO.
