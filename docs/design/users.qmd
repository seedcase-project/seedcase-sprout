## Data and Action types
We have chosen to use the CRUD framework when documenting interactions between users and data.  There are two types of data in Seedcase Sprout, Research data and data about Research data (metadata). 

The research data is the data that a user of Seedcase Sprout wish to store, this can be a variety of formats, although Sprout - in its current iteration - will handle only tabular data.  The metadata (data about data), it the data the a user creates in preparation for storing research data. It is expected that almost all users of Seedcase Sprout will have access to create research data, but only some will have the option to create, update, and/or delete metadata and research data. 

We believe that it is important to build a system which offers the greatest amount of flexibility for the users, which also means that it will be possible for a high level user (referred to below as Users Access Administrators) to be able to customize access for their own users. We do at the same time acknowledge that not all teams will want to set their own user groups up, which is why we aim to offer a set of 'ready-made' user groups as described below.

## User types
Sprout is built for the target users described below.

### Data Contributors

Data contributors will be uploading or inputting collected data into the
database. We assume that these users are from authorized research or
data collection centers and are researchers, technicians, or other
research personnel. They are the people responsible for inputting data
into the database of a specific Data Resource managed by Sprout.

These users will:

-   Upload standardized and routine data through a public web portal.
-   Upload collected data through an internal portal.
-   Upload collected data through a local-only portal (on a work
    computer and not a server).
-   Upload new variables generated using existing variables (for
    instance, from new calculations of existing variables) from a
    project using data from the Data Resource, either through an
    internal portal or a public web portal.

Some data will need to be manually processed and cleaned by the users
before being inputted (or input in raw form and processed with a plugin
or extension). For instance, some data may have been entered into an
Excel spreadsheet, which is well-known to modify the values without the
users knowledge (e.g. date values), and may incorrectly save data in the
wrong data type. This type of data entry errors need human attention to
fix before they can correctly be put into Sprout.

### User Access Administrators

User Access Administrators are responsible for managing and controlling
user accesses, i.e., who can contribute data and whether those data
contributors have access to structure the database itself. These admin
users may or may not also be the data controllers/owners or they may be
acting on behalf of them.

These users will:

-   Approve and authorize who can upload to the database.
-   Approve and authorize who can make changes to the structure of the
    database.
-   Manage collection centers' access and authorization.

### Data Management Administrators

Data Management Administrators are responsible for the database itself
and the quality of the data that gets entered into Sprout. They may or
may not be the same user as the User Access Administrators and the data
controllers/owners.

These users will:

-   Initially structure the core database tables (e.g. the database key
    to link data together) and allocate space in the raw data file
    storage.
-   Manage or handle potential issues with the data itself that are
    detected from validation checks, through direct access to the
    database and data storage.
