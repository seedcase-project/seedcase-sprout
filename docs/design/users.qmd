## Data and action types

We use the CRUD framework when documenting interactions
between users and data. There are three types of data in Seedcase Sprout,
Research data, data about Research data (metadata), and data about Users.

The research data is the data that a user of Seedcase Sprout wish to
store, this can be a variety of formats, although Sprout - in its
current iteration - will handle only tabular data. The metadata is the data the a user creates in preparation for storing
research data. It is expected that almost all users of Seedcase Sprout
will have access to create research data, but only some will have the
option to create, update, and/or delete metadata and research data.

We believe that it is important to build a system which offers the
greatest amount of flexibility for the users, which also means that it
will be possible for a high level user to be able to customize access for their own
users. We do at the same time acknowledge that not all teams will want
to set their own user groups up, which is why we aim to offer a set of
'ready-made' user groups as described below.


## User types

Sprout is built for the target users described below. It is important to
note that it is possible for an individual to have more than one role. If they are to do everything we would expect them to have the role of Project Owner.

| Action | Type of data | DC | DMA  | PO | 
|--------|---------------------|-----|-----|-----|
| Create | Research Data       | X   | X   | X   |
|        | Metadata            |     | X   | X   | 
|        | User Data           |     |     | X   | 
| Read   | Research Data       | ?   | X   | X   | 
|        | Metadata            |     | ?   | X   | 
|        | User Data           |     | X   | X   | 
| Update | Research Data       |     | X   | X   | 
|        | Metadata            |     | X   | X   | 
|        | User Data           |     |     | X   | 
| Delete | Research Data       |     | ?   | X   | 
|        | Metadata            |     | ?   | X   | 
|        | User Data           |     |     | X   |

### Data management administrators (DMA)

Data management administrators are responsible for the database itself
and the quality of the data that gets entered into Sprout. We assume
that they will be people familiar with the research data. They are the
people primarily responsible for dealing with creating and updating
metadata.

These users will:

-   Log in and set up metadata structures.
-   Complete metadata (in particular the description of individual data
    fields).
-   Be on call for potential data issues that the Data contributors (described below)
    can't resolve.

### Data contributors (DC)

Data contributors will be uploading or inputting collected data into
Sprout. We assume that these users are from authorized research or data
collection centers and are researchers, technicians, or other research
personnel. They are the people responsible for inputting data into the
database managed by Sprout.

These users will upload data in a format determined by the metadata
defined by the Data management administrator(s). These
users will also have access to forms where data can be entered
directly (eg. during a clinic consultation), or upload other types of
data (eg. scans or images) when these features are added to Sprout.

These users will be able to:

-   Log in and upload standardised and routine data through a web portal
    into pre-defined metadata (i.e., table structures) set up by the Data management administrator(s) or Project owner(s).

### Project owner (PO)

The Project Owner is the person who can do everything in the system.
Often this will be the same person that has set up the instance of
Seedcase Sprout, and as can be seen in the table above they have access
to all four action types for all three types of information. This will
also be the person who in later versions of Seedcase will potentially
have access to the backend of Seedcase and be able to grant access
directly to the database, should the team/organisation have a database
administrator.
