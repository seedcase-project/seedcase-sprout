Sprout is built for these target users.

## Users inputting collected data into the database

These users we assume are authorized research or data collection centers, researchers, or technicians. They would be the people responsible for inputting data into the database of the specific Data Resource managed by Sprout. 

1. Authorized centers (general practitioner clinics or hospitals) upload standardized and routine data through a public web portal.
2. Authorized researchers upload generated data (e.g. created new variables of existing ones) from projects using data from the Data Resource, either through an internal portal or a public web portal.
3. Authorized researchers upload collected data through a local-only portal.
4. An authorized research group uploads collected data through an internal portal.

Some data will need to be manually processed and cleaned by the users before being inputted (or input in raw form and processed with a plugin or extension).

## Users who are administrators and data controllers/owners

These users are people who manage and control who can upload data and how the data will be structured.

1. Initial structuring of core database tables (e.g. the database key to link data together) and allocating space in the raw data file storage. 
2. Approve and authorize who can upload to the database.
3. Manage collection centers' access and authorization.
4. Manage or handle potential issues with the data itself, through direct access to the database and data storage.
