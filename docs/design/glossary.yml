  people and what they intend to do with information that is collected.

metadata: |
  Metadata is any information that describes, documents, or explains it's connected data. 
  What is considered metadata (and data) is dependent on people and what they intend to
  do with the information. Usually metadata is used to help understand and better analyze
  data. In the context of Seedcase Sprout, metadata is any information that helps understand
  the data better. For example, it would be the column name, the data type, how the data was 
  collected, and what the units are.
