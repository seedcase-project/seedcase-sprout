This section describes the concrete behaviour, interactions, and
pathways that data take within Seedcase. "Runtime" in this case refers
to how the software works "in action".

## Login and Authentication

Almost all users will need to log into the Seedcase-managed Data
Resources. The steps for logging in and having their permission levels
checked follows the sequence described in the figure below.

## Data Input

The overall aim of this section is to describe the general path that
data takes through a Seedcase Data Resource, from input into the final
output. Specifically, these items are described as:

-   *Input*: Because we currently focus on health research, the type of
    input data and metadata will be what is typically generated from
    health studies.
-   *Output*: The final output object would be the input data stored
    together as a single database, or at least multiple databases and
    files explicitly linked in such a way that it conceptually
    represents a single database.
-   *Path*: The computational and programmatic steps the input data and
    metadata takes from being uploaded by a human (and potentially
    automatically by a program) into Seedcase, passing through quality
    control checks, adding to the changelog, and storage into the
    database.

### Expected Type of Input Data

Given the (current) focus on health data as well as our own experiences,
we make some assumptions about the type of data that will be input into
Seedcase. Health data tends to consist of specific types of data:
<!---
-   **Clinical**: This data is typically collected during patient visits
    to doctors. Depending on the country or administrative region, there
    will likely already be well-established data processing and storage
    pipelines in place. --->
-   **Register**: This type of data is highly dependent on the country
    or region. Generally, this data is collected for national or
    regional administrative purposes, such as, recording employment
    status, income, address, medication purchases, and diagnoses. Like
    the routine clinical data, the pipelines in place for processing and
    storage of this data are usually very extensive and established. 
<!---
-   **Biological sample analysis**: This type of data is generated from
    biological samples, like blood, saliva, semen, hair, or urine. Data
    generated from sample analytic techniques often produce large
    volumes of data per person. Samples may be generated in larger
    established laboratories or in smaller research groups, depending on
    how what analytic technology is used and how new it is. The
    structure and format of the generated data also tends to be highly
    variable and depends heavily on the technology used, sometimes
    requiring specialized software to process and output. --->
-   **Survey or questionnaire**: This type of data is often done based
    on a given study's aims and research questions. There are hundreds
    of different questionnaires that can have highly specific purposes
    and uses for their data. They are also highly variable in the volume
    of data collected based on the survey, and on the format of the
    data.

### Expected Flow of Input Data

The above described data tends to fit into, mostly, two categories for
data input.

-   *Routine or continuous collection*, where ingested data into
    Seedcase would occur as soon as the data was collected from one
    "observational unit"[^1] or very shortly afterwards. Clinical data
    as well as survey or questionnaire data may likely fall under this
    category.
-   *Batch collection*, where ingested data occurs some time after the
    data was collected and from multiple observational units. Biological
    sample data would fall under this category, since laboratories
    usually run several samples at once and input data after internal
    quality control checks and machine-specific data processing. While
    register-based data does get collected continuously, direct access
    to it is only given on a batch basis, usually once every year.
    Survey data may also come in batches, depending on the questionnaire
    and software used for its collection.

[^1]: Observational unit is the "entity" that the data was collected
    from at a given point in time, such as a human participant in a
    cohort study or a rat in an animal study at a specific time point.

For sources of data from routine collection with well-established data
input processes, the data input pipeline would likely involve
redirecting these data sources from their generation into Seedcase via a
direct call to the API so the data continues on to the backend and
eventual data storage.

Sources of data that don't have well-established data input processes,
such as from hospitals or medical laboratories, would need to use the
Seedcase data batch-input Web Portal. This Portal would only accept data
that is in a pre-defined format (as determined and created by the data
owner) and would include documentation, and potentially automation
scripts, on how to pre-process the data prior to uploading it.

These uploaded files might be a variety of file types, like `.csv`,
`.xls`, or `.txt`). Only users with the correct permission levels are
allowed to upload data. In either case it will be the administrator who
will be doing the initial upload, as that will entail setting up tables
and allocating space in the raw data file storage. The second way of
getting data into the Data Resource is by manually enter it by an
authorized user.

Once the data is submitted through the Portal, it would get sent in an
encrypted, legally-compliant format to the server and stored in the way
defined by the API and common data model.

### Preparation for Getting Data into Sprout

An approved user will open the login screen in the Web Portal. They
will enter their credentials which will be transmitted to the API layer.
The API Security layer will check with the list of users and permissions
in the database and confirm that the specific user has permission to
enter data into a specific table (or set of tables) in the database.

Once this check is complete the frontend will receive permission from
the API Security layer to display the data entry/upload options.

Before any of the actions described below can be done, it is expected that appropriate table schemas or entry forms have been created by one or more administrators of the system.  This process is described elsewhere.

<!--TODO change elsewhere above to the actual location of where we describe table schema and data entry form creation-->

#### Batch Upload of Data 

The user has selected a valid table schema to use, and have uploaded the file to the holding area. This prompts the system to check that the data in the file match the schema in the database on headers and data type. If this validation is successful then the system will inform the user about how many rows of data it found and validated. If the user is in agreement, then the system will write the data into the relevant table and display a confirmation back to the user. Should the user disagree with the number of rows then they cancel the upload and take the file away to investigate why the system can't see the correct number of rows, this is an action which happens outside of Seedcase.

#### Manual Data Entry: Done in One Session

The user completes all fields in the form and clicks "Save and Submit". This sends
the data to the API layer where it is confirmed as valid, parcelled up
and submitted to the database. The database will then write the data
into a new record in the table (or tables). Once done the database will
confirm successful entry of data to the API which will in turn send the
confirmation back to the user via the frontend.

Resource.](/design/images/runtime-manual-data-entry.png){#fig-manual-data-entry}

#### Manual Data Entry: Done in Multiple Sessions

There may be situations where an approved user will be prevented from
completing the data entry form in one session. In that case it would be
beneficial if there is an option of saving the data as it is, and be
able to return to the data entry at a later time. Much of the initial
workflow is the same as above, until the user is interrupted and selects
"Save" instead of "Save and Submit". This will send the data to the API with
a flag showing that fields may be incomplete, thus preventing the API
from rejecting the data due to NULL values. The API will submit the data
to the database along the incomplete flag.

When the user at a later time goes back to the data entry they will be
presented with the option of completing any incomplete records as well
as entering new data. If they click on "Complete Records" they are shown
the records that they have started but not submitted. Once they select a
partially completed record the frontend will request the currently
completed items from the database via the API layer before displaying
the entry form with the completed fields.

Once the user has completed more data they can either click on "Save" or
"Save and Submit". The first option will put them back to the top of this
workflow, the second will send the data back to the API layer for
validation. Once the data is validated it will be submitted to the
database. The database will then write the data into a new record in the
table (or tables) and update the flag to show the record is complete.
Once done the database will confirm successful entry of data to the API
which will in turn send the confirmation back to the user via the front
end.
