title Sprout-v1: Schema Creation (Preparation for Data Upload)
' User prepares to upload data by creating data schema

participant "User" as u
participant "Front end" as f
participant "API" as api
participant "Backend" as b

u -> f: User selects option to "Upload data"
f -> u: System shows data entry UI
u -> f: User selects the file (csv) to upload\nand clicks "Create New Schema"
' What "schema" means might not be understandable for all users. Description needed?
f -> api: System transfers file to API
api -> api: System extracts headers and analyse data types
api -> api: System checks for missing definitions*
api -> f: System transfers extracted headers and definitions*
' HOTSPOT: Data ingress file life cycle?
f -> u: System shows headers and definitions* to user
note right of u
    Descriptions will always be missing from
    definitions* initially, since they are not
    found in the file
end note
u -> f: User completes and/or edits definitions*
f -> api: User clicks "Save and Submit"
api -> api: System validates schema\n(i.e., checks for missing fields definitions*)
group Validation error (missing definitions*)
    api --> f: System sends back error with missing fields highlighted
    f --> u: System shows headers and definitions* to user
    u --> f: User completes and/or edits definitions*
    f --> api: User clicks "Save and Submit"
    api --> api: System validates data\n(i.e., checks for missing fields definitions*)
end
group Validation success (no missing definitions*)
    api -> b: System posts schema with "Completed" flag
    b -> b : System creates record\nand logs data changes
    b -> api: System confirms created schema
    api -> f: System retrieves confirmation
    f -> u: System displays confirmation
end
footer \n*Definitions include a header (variable name), data type, description (sentence describing what's in the variable),and an optional title (reader friendly variable name)\nExample:\nHeader = "adr1",\ndata type = varchar,\ndescription = "first address line of patient's address",\ntitle (optional): "address line 1"

' Question: Are users able to edit headers or are they "set" by the data/file/csv?
