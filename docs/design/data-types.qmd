# Data types in use in Seedcase Sprout

When defining a table template before upload of data the data types will be chosen from a pre-defined list of data types. These will be a subset of the data types that are available no matter which database we chose to work with.

## Main data types

The primary data types in most databases are text, numbers, dates and some form of yes/no (boolean) option.  We expect that this first iteration of Seedcase Sprout will be able to handle one or two of each of those, as well as some that are more machine-readable.

### Text
Raw text without any form of manipulation should be one of the primary types of data that Seedcase Sprout will store.  The precise name will vary depending on the database system, it may be referred to as Char, Varchar, nVarchar, or Text. In most systems more than one variation will be in use, all dependent on what input the person setting up the tables would expect to see saved. All variations of Char will have an option of limiting the number of characters that it is possible to store, this was especially crucial when disk space was at a premium, and can still be used as a blunt form of validation of data being saved to a table (eg. you can't save the full name of a US state, if the field is limited to 2 characters).

#### Choice, Naming, and Description in Seedcase Sprout

We will be using the Varchar without a limit at this point in time as Text is not a standard SQL type at present.  

|Name used in user interfaces |Description |
| --- | ------ |
| Text  | This is a text field without a limit on how much text can be stored in the field. Please see our documentation on the Seedcase website for further information.  |

### Numbers
There are several options when it comes to dealing with storing numbers in a database. The most basic is the Integer, which stores whole numbers (both positive and negative). This data type is typically used where a decimal number doesn't make sense (eg. when you are counting people, you can't have half a person). Often though, it is important to be able to record a decimal number, which will allow for greater precision, and is often used when storing for instance measurements or lab results. The choice of number format will also in some instances allow for the database to enforce data quality, by rejecting data at upload if it doesn't conform to type (eg. height is stored in cm, but there is a reading in meters, if the value is an integer then the height of 1.69 won't be allowed).

#### Choice, Naming, and Description in Seedcase Sprout

We will be offering two options for number formats for now, the Integer for whole numbers and double precision (or float), for decimal numbers.

|Name used in user interfaces |Description  |
| --- | ----- |
| Whole number   | Also known as Integer. This is a number field which will only allow whole numbers to be stored. Pick this option if you want to store whole numbers (like postcode, number of people in a household, or height in cm), not if you want to store things like lab results. Please see our documentation on the Seedcase website for further information. |
| Decimal number | Also known as Float or Double Precision. This is a number field which will store decimal numbers. Pick this option if you want to store things like lab results, or height in meters. You should look at Whole number if you want to store things like postcodes. Please see our documentation on the Seedcase website for further information. |
