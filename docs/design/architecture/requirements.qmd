## Technical requirements

-   Run on Windows, MacOS, and Linux (likely on servers): Our potential
    users work on any of these systems, so we need to design for that
-   Use open source software dependencies: We will use an open license,
    so we need to use components that are open as well
-   Integrate GDPR, privacy, and security compliance: Our target users
    work with health data, so this is vital to consider
-   Deployable to servers and locally: Could be used locally but mainly
    used on a server environment
-   Storage and computing may be at different locations: Where data are
    stored vs analyzed will likely be different

### Core functionality

-   **One Seedcase "instance" per Data Resource**: Some users may have
    multiple Data Resources, so the Seedcase Product will create
    separate "instances" for each Data Resource.
-   **Upload or update data**: Input data into the Data Resource in
    batches or continuously into the backend storage, either into the
    database or as raw data files.
-   **Upload or update metadata**: When inputting data, attach metadata
    along side it.
-   **Store changes to the data in a changelog**: Track and list changes
    made to the data within the Data Resource for auditing and
    recordkeeping.
-   **Display metadata and basic information on the data in the Data
    Resource on a user interface**: So external users and users
    interested in data in the Data Resource can browse what is
    available.
