Sprout must:

-   Run on Windows, MacOS, and Linux (likely on servers): Our potential
    users work on any of these systems, so we need to ensure compatibility across
    most commonly used operating systems.
-   Integrate GDPR, privacy, and security compliance: Our target users
    work with health data, so this is vital to consider
-   Run remotely on servers and locally on computers: The location where
    data are stored should be flexible based on the needs and
    restrictions of the user.
-   Be able to handle a variety of data file sizes: While the size of
    research data does not compare to those found in industry, it can
    still become large enough that it requires special care and
    handling.
-   Store data in a format that is open source, integrates with many
    tools, and is storage efficient: Sprout is first and foremost a data
    engineering tool for research data storage and distribution (or at
    least, easier sharing).
-   Store, organize, and manage multiple distinct data sources per user
    or group of users (for example in a server setting): Researchers rarely
    collect and work on one data source at any
    given time. So, Sprout must be able to handle multiple distinct data
    sources.
-   Upload and update data: Data can be added to Sprout could happen in
    batches or on a more frequent basis. We anticipate that batch
    uploads will be the most common.
-   Store, organize, and manage metadata connected to the data: Metadata
    are vital to understanding the data and its context, without which
    data can be near useless. Sprout needs to make managing and
    organizing metadata fundamental to its functionality.
-   Track changes to the data in a changelog and versioning system: Data
    are not static and can change over time. Sprout must
    track these changes and provide a way to show, track, and manage
    versions of the data. This is also necessary for legal compliance
    for auditing and record-keeping.

 Sprout will not:

-   Run any analytic computing or data science work: While some
    data processing and analysis will occur, it will be limited
    to running checks on the quality of the data and metadata.
