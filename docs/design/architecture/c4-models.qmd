title: "C4 Models"
---

This section contains the [C4 Models](https://c4model.com/) for Sprout.
The C4 Model is an established visualization approach to describe the
architecture of a software system. It breaks the system down into four
levels of architectural abstraction: Context, Containers, Components,
and Code. The last level is rarely used nor recommended for most
software architecture since it is used to visualize a high degree of
detail that most projects don't need. For our needs, we only needed to
create the **Context** and **Containers** diagrams.

These diagrams and their content draw from our overall Seedcase [design
documentation](https://design.seedcase-project.org/) and [design
decisions](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/). See those websites
for more information.

## Context

The Context diagram shows the users and any external systems that
interact with Sprout. This includes the user roles described in the
[User Personas](user-personas.qmd) page.

For some reason, these diagrams don't display well on some browsers like
Firefox. To see them, try using a different browser like Chrome or Edge.

## Container

The Container diagram shows the larger parts of the system, what they
are responsible for, and how they interact with each other. It also
shows the technology choices for each container.
