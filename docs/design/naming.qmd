title: "Naming scheme"
---

{{< include /docs/includes/_wip.qmd >}}

This document describes a general naming scheme for Sprout that
is guided by our [style guide](https://design.seedcase-project.org/style/)
as well as by the [Frictionless
Framework](https://v4.framework.frictionlessdata.io/) and [Data
Package](https://datapackage.org/) structure. This naming scheme *only*
applies to file paths, data objects, functions, URLs, API endpoints, and
command line interfaces that are exposed to or associated with
user-facing content. It does *not* apply to internal content; see the
style guide for details on naming internal (developer-facing) content.

We'll compose names based on the objects we and our users interact with
as well as the actions taken on those objects. Following along with the
Data Package terminology, we simplify "data package" to "package" and
"data resource" to "resource". We use the words "property" or "properties"
to describe package and resource metadata contained
in the `datapackage.json` file that follows the Frictionless Data
specification.

## Objects
