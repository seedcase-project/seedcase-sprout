Sprout is designed to structure, organize, and store data in a
standardized, coherent, and consistent way. At the base of how data is
structured and stored are the files and folders. So, this document
describes the main file and folder structure output when using Sprout.
It is split into two sections:

-   the file system when used either locally or via the code-based way
    (through Python or the command line) in a user-controlled and
    terminal-only server, or
-   the file system when used as a web app on a server.

## Local file and folder structure

We follow our [naming scheme](/docs/design/architecture/naming.qmd), as well as the [Frictionless
Data
specification](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-frictionless-data/),
to decide on the structure and name of the files and folders. All data
stored in Sprout for a specific set of conditions is called a data
package and each set of data within the data package is called a data
resource (see Note below).

::: callout-note
When a user starts using Sprout to structure their data, that data will
form a [Data Package](https://datapackage.org) (from the Frictionless Data standard). A data
package is called many things in other fields. For instance it could be
a "cohort study data", a "data resource", a database, a clinical trial
dataset, a dataset, a study dataset, simply "data", or any other combination
of words that include the word data. To keep it
consistent with the Frictionless Data standard, we name it a data
package.

A data package consists of one or more files (called data resources) that contain
data specific to a given set of conditions. For instance, a data package
could be a research study that collects information from people older
than 50 who live in Denmark and who have diabetes. In this example data
package, there might be data collected on basic demographics like
gender, ethnicity, or education, or on blood sample data like blood
glucose, cholesterol, or blood pressure. Here, the basic demographics
could be one data resource, while the blood sample data could be another
data resource within the data package.

### Folders

The folders that Sprout creates and uses are:

`SPROUT_ROOT/`

:   The location where Sprout will store all data that form one or more
    data packages. This location can be changed depending on the needs
    of the users. The default location is determined based on the
    operating system and where Sprout is installed locally by a user or on a
    server. An example default location for a local
    computer, where Sprout is installed on a user's drive, would be
    `/home/USERNAME/.sprout/`.

`SPROUT_ROOT/packages/<id>/`

:   All data packages are stored in the `packages/` folder and given an
    `<id>` (a whole number).
    Each `<id>` folder contains all the files relevant for **one** data
    package.

`SPROUT_ROOT/packages/<id>/resources/<id>/`

:   Whenever a specific type of data, like demographics data or blood sample data,  is stored in the data package, it
    will be stored as a data resource. In general, a data resource
    encompasses data collected in a specific way and for a specific set
    of measurements from a specific set of input sources for a specific
    purpose. The data resource(s) will always be within one specific
    package, with each data resource in its own folder based on a number `<id>`, e.g. `packages/1/resources/1/`.

    ::: callout-note
    Using the demographics and blood sample example above, the reason
    why these sources of data would be considered two separate data resources,
    rather than a single, joint data resource, is because, while
    they both collect data on the same group of people, they collect the
    data in different ways. The demographic data is usually collected
    with a survey by a researcher or technician (or the participant
    themselves if online) and obtained in a relatively consistent way using
    some survey software. Meanwhile, the blood sample data is usually
    taken at a specific time and analyzed by a specific machine by a
    specific laboratory in a specific way that is output in a specific
    format. The two types of data are collected in different ways and should be recognized
    as separate entities and thus separate data resources, even though they contain data about the same group of people.
    :::

`SPROUT_ROOT/packages/<id>/resources/<id>/raw/`

:   Whenever data is stored and structured for a specific data resource,
    the original unprocessed and untouched data will be kept in this
    `raw/` folder as a backup and in case anything unexpected happens during the
    import stage. Given how messy data often is and given how some data
    storage formats (e.g. Excel) often have their own way of storing and
    encoding information, computer mistakes can happen that are not
    caused by any human error.
    The data in the `raw/` folder can potentially be used to determine
    where things went wrong if they did go wrong.

### Files

Sprout creates and uses these files:

`SPROUT_ROOT/packages/<id>/datapackage.json`

:   This machine-readable JSON file is the foundation of a data package
    and contains the full [Frictionless Data specification](https://datapackage.org/). This file
    contains the metadata on the package (like title, description, and contributors) as
    well as metadata on the data resources (like column names, data
    types, descriptions, and a path to the Parquet file with the data in it).

`SPROUT_ROOT/packages/<id>/README.md`

:   Since JSON isn't easy for a human to read, this `README.md` file
    will contain some basic information from the `datapackage.json` file
    that is structured in a human readable, auto-generated way. This
    file is largely used to a) adhere to interoperable principles and b)
    serve potentially as the basis for displaying information for a
    data package's landing page in the Sprout web app.

`SPROUT_ROOT/packages/<id>/database.sqlite`

:   This file contains all the data in the data package as a
    [SQLite](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-sqlite/)
    database. Each relational table within represents one data resource.
    The SQLite database is used because it is a lightweight, serverless,
    and self-contained database that is easy to use and manage. It is
    also a common database format that is used in many applications and
    is easy to export to other database formats. The file is only
    described within the `datapackage.json` file and is not classified
    as a data resource, so the database file cannot be used by software that follows the
    Frictionless Data standard. We use and provide it because of the
    features that formal databases provide, like indexing, querying, and
    data integrity. The `data.parquet` file described below will be the
    data resource that is linked within the `datapackage.json` file.

`SPROUT_ROOT/packages/<id>/resources/<id>/raw/<timestamp>-<uuid>.<extension>.gzip`

:   These are compressed raw data files associated with a specific
    resource. These files are kept intentionally raw and are copied
    directly from the input data the user provides to this file. This
    `raw/` folder will not be linked within the `datapackage.json` file.
    Every time a user adds or updates data to the data resource, the
    original file will be stored here before being processed for
    correctness and basic checks. Afterwards, it will be merged in with
    any existing data in the data resource's `data.parquet` file (for
    tabular data).

`SPROUT_ROOT/packages/<id>/resources/<id>/data.parquet`

:   When a user creates a data resource and adds or updates data in the
    resource, all resource data is processed and stored in the
    [Parquet](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-parquet/) data
    format (if it is tabular data). The reason there is both a Parquet
    file as well as a table in the SQLite database is the
    way the [Frictionless Data Package](https://datapackage.org/) specification describes and sets data
    resources. The specification requires either a path value or a data
    value to be set for a data resource, but does not allow for setting a
    table in a database as a value. So interoperability of the data
    package is achieved by providing the Parquet file, rather than the SQLite
    database. In this way, we use both the Parquet data file and the database
    table for different reasons, even though they contain
    the same data.
