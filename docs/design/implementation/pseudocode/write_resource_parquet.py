def build_resource_parquet(
    raw_files_path: list[Path], resource_properties: ResourceProperties
) -> Path:
    """Merge all raw resource file(s) and write into a Parquet file.

    This function takes the file(s) provided by `raw_files_path` and merges them into
    a `data.parquet` file. The Parquet file will be stored at the path found in `ResourceProperties.path`.
    While Sprout generally assumes
    that the files stored in the `resources/raw/` folder have already been
    verified and validated, this function does some quick verification checks
    of the data after reading it into Python from the raw file(s) by comparing
    with the current properties given by the `resource_properties`. All data in the
    `resources/raw/` folder will be merged into one single data object and then
    written back to the Parquet file. The Parquet file will be overwritten.

    If there are any duplicate observation units in the data, only the most recent
    observation unit will be kept. This way, if there are any errors or mistakes
    in older raw files that has been corrected in later files, the mistake can still
    be kept, but won't impact the data that will actually be used.

    Examples:

        ``` python
        import seedcase_sprout.core as sp

        sp.write_resource_parquet(
            raw_files_path=sp.path_resources_raw_files(1, 1),
            parquet_path=sp.path_resource_data(1, 1),
            properties_path=sp.path_package_properties(1, 1),
        )
        ```

    Args:
        raw_files_path: A list of paths for all the raw files, mostly commonly stored in the
            `.csv.gz` format. Use `path_resource_raw_files()` to help provide the
            correct paths to the raw files.
        resource_properties: The `ResourceProperties` object that contains the properties
            of the resource you want to create the Parquet file for.

    Returns:
        Outputs the path object of the created Parquet file.

    check_resource_properties(resource_properties)

    data = read_raw_files(raw_files_path)
    data = drop_duplicate_obs_units(data)

    # This function could be several functions or the one full function.
    check_data(data, resource_properties)
