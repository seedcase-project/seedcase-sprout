This documentation contains the design specific to Sprout, 

## Purpose

The core purpose of writing this architecture documentation is to be
able to describe to ourselves and others what Seedcase Sprout is aiming to
accomplish and how it will do that.

## Technical decisions

the Data Resource managed by Seedcase.](/design/images/context.png)

## Definition of terms

-   **Seedcase Product**: This is the software itself that is installed
    on computer or server.
-   **Data Resource**: {{< var design.data-resource >}}
-   **Data Project**: A data project, also called a data extract, would
    be a subset of data from a Data Resource that researchers or other
    analysts would request access to use for a specific purpose. This
    request, when approved, would result in a data extract that is sent
    to the user.

## Goals

Primary **goal** of Sprout are:

1.  **Ingesting data and metadata into standardized storage**: Take
    generated data from source locations (such as the clinic or
    laboratories) that may be distributed geographically or
    organizationally and store it in a secure, centralized location in a
    standardized and efficient format to form a Data Resource. Metadata
    are similarly stored and linked to the data.
