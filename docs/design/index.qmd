title: "Design"
---

The purpose of these documents is to describe the design of Sprout in
enough detail to help us develop it in a way that is sustainable (i.e.,
maintainable over the long term) and that ensures we as a team have a
shared understanding of what Sprout is and is not.

Sprout's design builds off of our overall Seedcase [design principles
and patterns](https://design.seedcase-project.org/), in that any design
we create for Sprout should strongly follow the same design principles
and patterns described there. Unless explicitly stated otherwise,
Sprout's design adds to but does not replace the overall design.

Below

There are two main sections of this design documentation:

-   [Architecture](architecture/index.qmd): The architecture section
    describes the high-level requirements, components, use cases,
    expected users, and how the system will be organized and structured.
-   [Interface](interface/index.qmd): The interface section gives a much
    more detailed description of the software interface for the
    architecture. The detail is at the level of exact Python functions
    and CLI commands, as well as their arguments, inputs, and outputs.

## Purpose

The overall aim of Sprout is to **take data and metadata and convert
them into a standardized and organized storage structure** that follows
best practices for data engineering, particularly with a focus on
research contexts. Specifically, Sprout aims to:

1.  Take generated data from various source locations (such as clinics
    or laboratories), which may be distributed geographically or
    organizationally, and store it in a standardized and efficient
    format.
2.  Ensure that metadata is included for the data and organized in a
    standardized format, explicitly and programmatically linking the
    metadata to the data.

Aligning with our modular design pattern to build software that has a
focused and narrow scope as well as that can be easily extended or
re-used

The aim of *Sprout Core* (this package) is to:

1.  Build a flexible, extensible, and fine-grained set of
    functionalities that implement the Sprout's overall design, that way
    users can easily configure and customize Sprout to their own needs.
    Specifically, to build functionality that supports us in building
    more opinionated interfaces and extensions of Sprout.

## Requirements

Overall, Sprout must:

-   Run on Windows, MacOS, and Linux: Our potential users work on any of
    these systems (including servers), so we need to ensure
    compatibility across most commonly used operating systems.
-   Integrate GDPR, privacy, and security compliance: Many of our users
    work with health or personally sensitive data.
-   Run remotely on servers and locally on computers: The location where
    data are stored should be flexible based on the needs and
    restrictions of the user.
-   Be able to handle a variety of data file sizes: While the size of
    research data does not compare to those found in industry, it can
    still become large enough that it requires special care and
    handling.
-   Store data in a format that is open source, integrates with many
    tools, and is storage efficient: Sprout is first and foremost a data
    engineering tool for research data storage and distribution (or at
    least, easier sharing).
-   Store, organize, and manage multiple distinct data sources per user
    or group of users (for example in a server setting): Researchers
    rarely collect and work on one data source at any given time. So,
    Sprout must be able to handle multiple distinct data sources.
-   Upload and update data: Data can be added to Sprout could happen in
    batches or on a more frequent basis. We anticipate that batch
    uploads will be the most common.
-   Store, organize, and manage metadata connected to the data: Metadata
    are vital to understanding the data and its context, without which
    data can be near useless. Sprout needs to make managing and
    organizing metadata fundamental to its functionality.
-   Track changes to the data in a changelog and versioning system: Data
    are not static and can change over time. Sprout must track these
    changes and provide a way to show, track, and manage versions of the
    data. This is also necessary for legal compliance for auditing and
    record-keeping.

In general, Sprout will not:

-   Run any analytic computing or data science work: While some data
    processing and analysis will occur, it will be limited to running
    checks on the quality of the data and metadata.

Aside from the overall requirements for Sprout, the requirements for
this *core* module of Sprout are:

-   Any individual functionality be as independent as possible: To keep
    it flexible and extensible, each functionality should (ideally) be
    able to run on its own without needing to depend on other
    functionality.
-   Assume as little as possible about the environment: For each
    functionality, ideally assume as little about the current state of
    the environment as possible. For instance, what the exact path is on
    the filesystem or where in the filesystem the software is running.
-   Make as few assumptions and expectations as is reasonable: This
    package should not be designed to be (too) opinionated about the
    order steps are taken, what steps are taken, where they are taken,
    and other specific details.
