title: "Design of Sprout"
---

Within the design documentation are two main sections:

-   [Architecture](architecture/index.qmd): The architecture section
    describes the high-level requirements, components, use cases,
    expected users, and how the system will be organized and structured.
-   [Interface](interface/index.qmd): The interface section describes a
    much more detailed description of the software interface for the
    architecture. The detail is at the level of exact Python functions
    and CLI commands, as well as their arguments, inputs, and outputs.
