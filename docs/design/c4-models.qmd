title: "C4 Models"

This section contains the [C4 Models](https://c4model.com/) for Sprout.
The C4 Model is an established visualization approach to describe the
architecture of a software system. It breaks the system down into four
levels of abstraction: Context, Containers, Components, and Code. The
last level is rarely used nor recommended for most software architecture
since it is used to visualize a high degree of detail that most projects
don't need. Below is the diagrams for the Context, Containers, and
Components (which has three diagrams).

## Context

The Context model is mainly used to show the users and any external
systems that interact with Sprout.

## Container

The Container model is used to show larger parts of a system, what they
are responsible for and how they interact with each other. It also shows
technology choices for each Container.

## Component

The Component model offers a more detailed view of the system into what
the smaller parts are that make up an individual Container and that
allow it to fulfill its responsibilities. There are three diagrams for
the Components: the user interface, the server or internal management,
and the databases and storage.
