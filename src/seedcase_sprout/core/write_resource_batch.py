    """Writes the tidied, original data into the resource's batch data folder.

    Writes the original data that is in a Tidy format and read as a pl.DataFrame
    into the resource location available from the `path` property of the
    `resource_properties`. This will save a timestamped, unique file
    name to store it as a backup. See the
    [design](https://sprout.seedcase-project.org/docs/design/) docs for an
    explanation of this batch file. Data is always checked against the properties
    before writing it to the batch folder.

    Args:
        data: A Polars DataFrame object with the data to write to the batch folder.
        resource_properties: The properties object for the specific resource.
            Use `read_properties()` to read the properties for the resource
            and `get_resource_properties()` to get the correct resource properties.
        package_path: The path to the data package root folder (where `datapackage.json`
            is located). Defaults to the current working directory.

    Returns:
        The path to the written Parquet resource file.

    Raises:
        ExceptionGroup: A group of `CheckError`s, if resource properties are incorrect.
        # TODO: Add exception for data check when implemented.

    Examples:
        ```{python}
        import seedcase_sprout.core as sp

        with sp.ExamplePackage():
            resource_properties = sp.read_properties().resources[0]

                data=sp.example_data(),
                resource_properties=resource_properties,
            )
        ```
