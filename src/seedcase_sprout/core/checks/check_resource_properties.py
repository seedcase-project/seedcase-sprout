    This function expects an individual set of resource properties as input. Structural,
    type and format constraints are all checked. All schema violations are collected
    before errors are returned.

    The schema loaded or constructed in this function overrides any values specified
    in the `$schema` attribute of `properties`, including the default value.

    Args:
        properties: The resource properties to check.
        check_recommendations: Whether `properties` should be checked against
            recommendations in the Data Resource standard in addition to requirements.
            Defaults to True.

    Returns:
        A list of errors. An empty list, if no errors are found.
