    """Creates a new `datapackage.json` file with properties for a new package.

    This is the first function to use to create a new data package. It creates a
    `datapackage.json` file based on the values you give it with the `properties`
    argument. You can use the `PackageProperties` class to help create a valid
    properties object that has the correct fields.

    By default, the function will add the `id`, `version`, and `created` fields to the
    properties object. See the `PackageProperties` class documentation for more
    information.

    Args:
        properties: A `PackageProperties` object containing the properties for the
            package.
        path: The path to the folder where the data package will be created.
            Defaults to the working directory.

    Returns:
        The path to the `datapackage.json` file in the created folder.

    Raises:
        ExceptionGroup: If there is an error in the properties. A group of
            `CheckError`s, one error per failed check.

    Examples:
        ```{python}
        import tempfile
        from pathlib import Path

        import seedcase_sprout.core as sp

        # Create a temporary directory for the example
        with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
            temp_path = Path(temp_dir)

            # Create package properties
            sp.create_package_properties(
                # Using a built-in example properties object
                properties=sp.example_package_properties,
                path=temp_path
            )
        ```
