    """Writes the specified package properties to the `datapackage.json` file.

    Writes a set of package properties (with or without resource properties) back to the
    `datapackage.json` file. The `path` argument is the location of the
    `datapackage.json` file. Use the `path_properties()` function to provide this path
    to the correct location. Returns the same path object as given in the `path`
    argument.

    Args:
        path: The path to the `datapackage.json` file.
        properties: The package properties to write.

    Returns:
        The path to the updated `datapackage.json` file.

    Raises:
        ExceptionGroup: If there is an error in the properties. A group of
            `CheckError`s, one error for each failed check.
