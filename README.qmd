## seedcase-sprout: Grow structured, organised, and usable data

{{< include /docs/includes/_badges.qmd >}}

Sprout is one component of the [Seedcase
Project](https://seedcase-project.org) framework that aims to take data
created or collected for research studies and "grow" it in a structured
way using modern data engineering best practices. Sprout is designed to
organise, describe, and store data for effective discovery, management,
and analysis.

Check out our [website](https://sprout.seedcase-project.org/) for more
information, such as an
[overview](https://sprout.seedcase-project.org/docs/overview/), how to
use it [guide](https://sprout.seedcase-project.org/docs/guide/), or to
read about the
[design](https://sprout.seedcase-project.org/docs/design/). For a list
of changes, see our
[changelog](https://sprout.seedcase-project.org/docs/releases/) page.

## Installing

Seedcase Sprout can be installed in two ways. The first is to install it
as a user, and the second is to install it as a contributor.

[guidebook](https://guidebook.seedcase-project.org/) for more specific
details on how we work and develop. It is a regularly evolving document,
so is at various states of completion.

To install Sprout to contribute, you first need to install
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and
[justfile](https://just.systems/man/en/packages.html). We use uv and
justfile to manage our project, such as to install development
dependencies. Both uv and justfile website have a more detailed guide on
using uv, but below are some simple instructions to get you started.

To install uv, run:

``` bash
pipx install uv
```

Then, open a terminal so that the working directory is the root of this
project (`seedcase-sprout/`) and run:

``` bash
