## seedcase-sprout: Grow structured, organised, and usable data

{{< include /docs/includes/_badges.qmd >}}

Sprout is one component of the [Seedcase
Project](https://seedcase-project.org) framework that aims to take data
created or collected for research studies and "grow" it in a structured
way using modern data engineering best practices. Sprout is designed to
organise, describe, and store data for effective discovery, management,
and analysis.
