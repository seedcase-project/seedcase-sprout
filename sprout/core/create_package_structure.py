def create_package_structure(path: Path) -> list[Path]:
    """Sets up the folder structure for a new package.

    This is the first function to use to create a new data package. It assigns a package
    ID and then creates a package folder and all the necessary files for a package
    (excluding the resources), outputting the file paths for the created files.

    Args:
        path: The path to the folder containing the packages. Use `path_packages()`
            to provide the correct path location.

    Returns:
        A list of paths to the two created files, the datapackage.json and the
            README.md, as well as one created `resources/` folder.

    Raises:
        NotADirectoryError: If the directory in the path doesn't exist.
        FileNotFoundError: If a file could not be created.
        TypeError: If `datapackage.json` could not be created.
